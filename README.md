## Description

In this Challenge, I used node, express, and mongoose to create a Budget Tracker App which can be installed an a Progressive Web App \(PWA\), this app can be used to create and add on to a list of deposit/withdrawal based transactions and visualize the changes via a canvas element chart. It utilizes the express router for configuraiton and set up of the needed routes and takes in number and name input from the user for the transactions. The user can utilize the PWA features of the installed application to use as a standalone application, meaning the user can add transactions to the tracker even while offine and have the application update the transactions when the user gets online again. The user will also be able to view previously added transactions from the cached version of the app.
